# My journey to data science-hood

Hello! I am currently working as a data analyst with an interest in bioinformatics, data engineering and data science. I started my data journey in early 2022 and I am currently enrolled on the [DataTalksClub data engineering](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) course as part of the 2024 cohort.
