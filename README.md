**A humble research technician's journey to data science-hood**

Hello! I'm a microbiology graduate, currently working as a professional in the research industry. I have an interest in bioinformatics and data science, and started learning python in early 2022.

All the notebooks that are labelled 'beginner', 'intermediate', etc. are practice projects that i've done since learning python, and so (particularly some of the earlier ones) might be a 'little rough around the edges' or basic. I tried to do as many as I could when I picked up a new technique or library.
